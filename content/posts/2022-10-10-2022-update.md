Wow. It's been almost 2 years since my last post here! What a crazy period of time we've been through...

### I'm still around

I'm making this short post to let you know that
- I'm alive
- I still check in on my blog from time to time!

In fact, earlier today I finally shipped a weekend project I've been hacking on for this site: **Table of Contents**! If you're on desktop, you should be able to see it on the right ‚û°Ô∏è (sorry mobile users).

### Year Two Goals Check-In

Back in February 2020, I posted a [recap of my first year of blogging](/blog/year-one/) and [set some goals](/blog/year-one/#3-goals-for-year-two) for Year Two that basically simplify to:

- Grow organic traffic
- Increase pageviews but also subscribers
- Write more posts with co-authors

 Unsurprisingly, I did not hit those goals. I haven't been spending nearly as much time on this blog as I used to, and that's okay!

 **I won't be setting more goals for this blog** for the foreseeable future, but I do hope to continue improving it and posting new content from time to time.

### Data Check-In

In my aforementioned [Year One Recap](/blog/year-one/), I also included some data around how the blog was doing. I'm not going to put that much effort in this time, but here's a super quick data update:

| Metric | Feb 2020 | Oct 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cumulative Pageviews | 642k | 1632k |
| Unique Users | 310k | 779k |

Hooray for surpassing 1 million pageviews! üéâ

### What am I doing now?

I've been helping build [gather.town](https://www.gather.town/) for the past 2 years. Don't hesitate to [reach out](/contact/) to me if you're interested in working with me!
