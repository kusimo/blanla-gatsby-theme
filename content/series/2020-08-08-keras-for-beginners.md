[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a so simple-to-use but powerful deep learning library for Python. This 3-post series, written for beginners, provides a simple way for anyone to get started solving real machine learning problems. Weâ€™ll start with an introduction to **classic Neural Networks** for complete beginners before delving into two popular variants: **Recurrent Neural Networks** (RNNs) and **Convolutional Neural Networks** (CNNs).
